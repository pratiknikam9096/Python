# Dynamic Programming (DP)

Definition: Optimization technique that stores results of overlapping subproblems to avoid recomputation.

Why used: Convert exponential recursive solutions into polynomial-time using memoization/tabulation.

Complexity: Varies — often O(n) or O(n*k) depending on state size.

Real-world: Making optimal change, resource allocation problems.

Diagram: DP state table example for knapsack or coin change (text table).

Advantages: Efficient for overlapping-subproblem problems.
Disadvantages: Identifying state and transitions can be non-trivial.

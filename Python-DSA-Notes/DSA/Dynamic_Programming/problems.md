# Dynamic Programming Problems (10)

1. Fibonacci with memoization / tabulation
2. Climbing stairs (simple DP)
3. 0/1 Knapsack
4. Coin change (min coins)
5. Longest increasing subsequence (n log n and DP)
6. Longest common subsequence
7. Edit distance (Levenshtein)
8. Partition equal subset sum
9. Maximum subarray (Kadane — DP viewpoint)
10. Word break

For each problem, provide both recursive+memo and iterative DP where appropriate.

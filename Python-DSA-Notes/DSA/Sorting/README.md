# Sorting

Common algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, Counting, Radix.

Time & Space (common):

- QuickSort: Avg O(n log n), Worst O(n^2)
- MergeSort: O(n log n), Space O(n)
- HeapSort: O(n log n), Space O(1)

Choose algorithm based on stability, space, and data properties.

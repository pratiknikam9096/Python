# Strings (DSA)

Definition: Sequence of characters.

Why used: String algorithms are used in parsing, search, and text processing.

Time & Space Complexity: Varies per algorithm (common ops O(n)).

Real-world: Text documents, DNA sequences.

Diagram (text):

Index: 0 1 2 3 4
Str:   a b a c a

Advantages: Human-readable, flexible.
Disadvantages: Some ops are O(n) due to immutability.

# Trees

Definition: Hierarchical data structure with nodes and child relationships (binary trees, BSTs, heaps).

Why used: Represent hierarchical relationships, enable fast search (BST), priority queues (heap).

Time & Space:

- Traversals: O(n)
- Search/insert in balanced BST: O(log n)

Advantages: Hierarchical modeling, efficient search in balanced trees.
Disadvantages: Complex balancing logic for AVL/Red-Black.

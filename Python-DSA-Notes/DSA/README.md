# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This folder contains topic-wise notes and solved problems for common data structures and algorithms used in interviews and competitive programming.

Each topic folder contains:

- `README.md` — notes, complexity, diagrams (text-based), pros/cons
- `problems.md` — at least 10 solved problems with approach, code, and complexity

Follow the recommended order: Arrays → Strings → Linked_List → Stack → Queue → Recursion → Searching → Sorting → Hashing → Trees → Graphs → Dynamic_Programming.

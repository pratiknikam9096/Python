# Queue Problems (10)

1. Implement queue with two stacks
2. Circular queue implementation
3. Sliding window maximum (deque)
4. Recent counter (sliding window)
5. Generate binary numbers 1..n using queue
6. Task scheduler simulation
7. BFS level order traversal
8. Implement monotonic queue
9. First unique character in a stream (use queue + counts)
10. Design hit counter (fixed window)

Most solutions use deque from `collections` for O(1) pushes/pops at both ends.

# Graph Problems (10)

1. BFS and DFS traversals
2. Detect cycle in directed graph (DFS colors)
3. Topological sort
4. Shortest path (Dijkstra)
5. Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal, Prim)
6. Number of connected components
7. Word ladder (BFS on word graph)
8. Clone graph
9. Graph bipartite check
10. Course schedule (cycle detection/topological)

Use adjacency list representation for sparse graphs; matrices for dense.

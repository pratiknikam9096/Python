# Hashing Problems (10)

1. Two-sum — use map
2. Group anagrams — map by sorted key
3. Top-k frequent elements — Counter + heap
4. Subarray sum equals K — prefix sums + hashmap
5. Longest consecutive sequence — set/hash
6. Isomorphic strings — map chars
7. Find repeated DNA sequences — rolling hash
8. LRU Cache (hash + doubly linked list)
9. Anagram mappings
10. Count pairs with given XOR — hash of prefixes

Hashing problems often use maps/sets and rely on careful handling of keys and collisions.

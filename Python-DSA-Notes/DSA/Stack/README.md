# Stack

Definition: LIFO (last-in-first-out) data structure.

Why used: Expression evaluation, backtracking, DFS.

Complexities:

- Push/Pop: O(1), Space: O(n)

Real-world: stack of plates — last placed is first removed.

Diagram:

Top -> [a]

       [c]

Advantages: Simple and efficient for LIFO tasks.
Disadvantages: Limited access; only top.

# Arrays

Definition: Ordered, indexed collection of elements stored contiguously.

Why used: Fast index access, memory-efficient, foundation for many algorithms.

Time & Space Complexity:

- Access: O(1)
- Search (unsorted): O(n)
- Insert/Delete (middle): O(n)
- Space: O(n)

Real-world example: an array is like a row of lockers numbered from 0..n-1.

Diagram (text):

Index: 0 1 2 3 4
Array: [5,2,8,3,9]

Advantages:

- Simple and fast indexing.

Disadvantages:

- Fixed-size in some languages; costly middle inserts/deletes.

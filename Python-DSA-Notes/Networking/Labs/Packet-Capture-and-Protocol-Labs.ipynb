    "- Install Wireshark, tcpdump/tshark, and have Python (3.8+) with `scapy`, `pyshark`, and `requests` available in a virtualenv.\n",
    "- Always run captures in an isolated lab environment (VMs or containers) and never on production networks without authorization.\n",

    "**Commands:**\n",
    "- tcpdump: `sudo tcpdump -i <iface> -w capture.pcap`\n",
    "- tshark: `tshark -r capture.pcap -Y \"http\" -V`\n",
    "- Wireshark: open `capture.pcap` and use display filters like `ip.addr == 10.0.0.5`"

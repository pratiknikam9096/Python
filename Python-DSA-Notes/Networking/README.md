# Networking

This folder contains two subfolders:

- `Notes/` — Comprehensive networking notes (basic → advanced) with security focus and protocol explanations.
- `Python-Testing/` — How Python is used for network testing, automation, basic defensive tools, and safe examples.

Use the contents for learning and labs; always have authorization before testing any network that isn't yours. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.

# Python for Network Testing & Security

This folder shows how Python supports network testing, automation, and security research. It contains:
- **python_examples.md** — concepts, libraries, safe examples, machine-learning notes for security.
- **scripts/** — small, safe scripts (sniffing, simple scanning, HTTP probing). Always test with permission.

Important: Only use tools and scripts against networks/systems you own or have explicit authorization to test. Unauthorized scanning or exploitation is illegal.
